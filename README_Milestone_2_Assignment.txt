                                      Principal Component Analysis Technique and Logistic Regression for Breast Cancer Dataset

Overview:
The breast cancer dataset is from sklearn.datasets. 

This model addresses the growing number of referrals in the following ways:
- By simplifying the complexity of the dataset through dimensionality reduction, the Clinic is able to effectively allocate its resources to patients that need it the most.

- PCA Techniques and Logistic Regression will help the Clinic make effective decisions such as: prioritization of cancer cases, optimization of treatment, employing more qualified Oncologists, etc.

- This model can be scaled to handle larger datasets with accuracy.

- The model can be regularly updated with new data as regards changing trends in patient demographics, success rates based on in-patient or out-patient care, etc.

- By automating the analysis of referrals, the workload of the Clinic is reduced. This allows the doctors and other hospital staff channel their time and resources to the patients.

- This model's predictive capabilities will enable the Clinic predict future trends in referrals, thereby allowing the Clinic prepare for an increase or otherwise in referrals.

By using PCA Techniques, the essential variables identified by the model which will help in securing donor funding are:
i) Concave Points, Concavity and Compactness: These variables are indicators of tumor aggression and malignancy. This model helps in early detection and this can attract donors to fund such software and also invest in advanced technologies.

ii) Fractal Dimension: This variable relates to the complex nature of tumor borders. This predicts the progression of cancer. This model tries to understand and target these complexities thereby encouraging investors to sponsor such projects or more advanced projects.

iii) Perimeter and Radius: This variable indicates the size of the tumor. All these shows that the Clinic is taking steps to enhance patient outcomes, which in turn will encourage funding from donors.
